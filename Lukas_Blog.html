<h3> What I'm Going For: </h3>
<P>I read the news partly to keep up on current events but mostly to educate myself on topics outside of my day-to-day. I don’t read a journal article on an industrials merger with the intention of rolling up a series of HVAC manufactures… I read it and hopefully learn something I can apply to my field. With this blog I hope to do the same – to write something accessible for the newcomer, not to contribute an expert opinion that moves healthcare and technology forward (at least not yet).  </P>

    <h3>Primer on SaaS</h3>
<h5 style="color:blue"> By: Lukas Lauer </h5>
<p>
    Software as a service (Saas) products are those that are hosted remotely and charge customers a recurring subscription to access. From the customer’s perspective, the Saas vendor handles everything - network, servers, operating systems, storage, maintenance, etc. thus taking this responsibility away from the customer’s IT department. In reality, the Saas product relies on a 3rd party cloud computing vendor (probably AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) to take care of all of this and they are mostly just responsible for developing the SaaS application that runs on it.
    <br>
    <br>
As opposed to what? Well, before SaaS and cloud computing, companies ran everything through an on premises server providing all employees with access to the applications and data on it. When the system needed to add users or hold more data, companies would have to purchase additional hardware (servers).
     <br>
    <br>
Ok, I’m not a technologist, developer, architect, or any other technical title that you can think of so I’ll leave the technology piece at that and now get into the actual business implications.
     <br>
    <br>
While SaaS is still relatively unknown outside of tech it has actually been around since the ‘90s and pretty much everyone who uses the internet uses SaaS products. For Example, Gmail is a type of SaaS product but really my intention is to focus on B2B products with prime examples such as Salesforce or Shopify.
     <br>
    <br>
You can offer a remotely hosted software sold on a perpetual license. You can’t really offer a on-premises software with a SaaS model
     <br>
    <br>
Traditionally, enterprise software has been sold with a perpetual license giving the customer the right to use it forever with an annual maintenance fee. A few years down the road the software vendor would try to upsell their latest and greatest version. This worked well because the software vendor is able to recognize all that revenue upon delivery of the license and the customer is basically locked in. There are however a few distinct drawbacks with this strategy. 1) the customer is responsible for all the IT costs of running it which can be significant 2) It’s much harder to release updates and new features when hosted on premises. This second point is crucial as it leads to software that is slowly becoming obsolete.
     <br>
    <br>
The business model for SaaS is fundamentally different from that of traditional software products. It is sold on a subscription basis ranging from monthly to multiple years. The product can be constantly updated and improved so that customers are always getting the best. Think of almost an online interaction you’ve had with the government – their tech looks so old because they bought the perpetual license to it a million years ago and never upgraded. While these subscriptions have a much smaller dollar value than a perpetual license, it can actually be more valuable over the long term. SaaS allows for better, more up to date software, providing greater value to the customer and allowing the vendor to capture more of the value for itself.

Since all of your revenue is on a subscription basis it is relatively easy to measure the value you can expect to get from each customer (LTV) by taking Average Revenue Per User (ARRPU) and dividing it by the average percentage of clients who unsubscribe in a given period (Churn). Profitwell has a great table outlining this calculation:

    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
On the cost side, the key metric is customer acquisition cost (CAC); what does it cost for you to get a new client? CAC includes the salaries of employees working in sales/marketing, any tools they use, and any money the company spends on paid acquisition (ads, etc.). Rule of thumb, LTV should be at least 3x higher than CAC, but it depends on the product/market.
